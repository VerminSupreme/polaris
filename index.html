        <h1 id="title" class="subtitle">Polaris</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Distance, location and magnitude</h2>
        <p>Polaris is 323 light years from earth, while the sun is only 8.2 light minutes away.            
            The star is loacted at the north celestial pole, and can be found at the end of the "handle" of the Little Dipper.
            <br><br>
            While it is known as Polaris, it has taken on many other names throughout history such as the Pole Star, Lodestar, and Cynosura.
            Today, it is also sometimes called the Northern Star or the Guiding star.
            <br><br>
            The star has an absolute magnitude of -3.64, and an apparent magnitude of 2.00.
            The sun, on the other hand, has an apparent magnitude of -26.74, and an absolute magnitude of 4.83.
            This means that the sun appears much brighter than Polaris from our perspective, but in reality Polaris the the brighter star between the two.            
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Star's Story</h2>
        <p>
            Partially due to the fact that Polaris is on the north celestial pole, it was intergrated into the mythology of multiple cultures.
            In Norse mythology, it was believed that Polaris was the end of a spike that the sky rotates around.
            This makes some sense due to the fact that the sty does in fact rotate around a point very near to Polaris.
            Similar to Norse mythology was the Mongolian idea that Polaris is a peg that holds the world together.
            <br><br>
            Polaris was also used for practical reasons throughout history.
            Sailors were able to use Polaris as a kind of compass to direct them, due to the fact that the star would always point them north.
